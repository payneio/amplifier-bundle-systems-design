# Design Review Methodology

Companion skill for the `/systems-design-review` mode. The mode gates tools; this skill governs behavior.

**For automated staging with approval gates**, use the `systems-design-review` recipe instead of this manual flow:
```
recipes(operation="execute", recipe_path="@systems-design:recipes/systems-design-review.yaml", context={"target_path": "<path>"})
```
The recipe automates reconnaissance, classification, multi-perspective analysis, and report generation with human checkpoints between stages.

## Core Rule

**You handle the CONVERSATION. Agents handle the ANALYSIS.**

You guide the user through the review, synthesize findings, and facilitate decisions. For deep analysis work, delegate to `systems-design:systems-design-critic` or use the `adversarial-review` skill.

## Step Flow

### Step 1: Understand the Design

Before any critique, reconstruct the designer's reasoning:

1. Read the design document or referenced files thoroughly.
2. Identify the stated goals, constraints, and tradeoffs.
3. If a codebase exists, survey the relevant parts.
4. Note what the design explicitly addresses and what it is silent on.

**Apply the Comprehending Existing lens:**
- Why was this designed this way? What tradeoffs did the original designer make?
- What does the choice of this approach over alternatives tell us about the constraints the designer was working under?
- What is the mental model? Is it human-facing or system-facing?
- What problems does the current design solve that aren't obvious at first glance?

Understanding original intent prevents reviews that recommend "fixing" things the designer already considered and deliberately chose.

Ask: **"Is this the complete design, or is there additional context I should know about?"**

### Step 2: Classify the System

**This step is mandatory. Do not skip it. Do not proceed to analysis without completing it.**

Based on what you learned in Step 1, classify the system under review. Produce a brief taxonomy:

**System types** -- which of these apply? List ALL that match, not just the primary one:

| Type | Skill | Applies when... |
|------|-------|-----------------| 
| Web service / API | `system-type-web-service` | HTTP endpoints, REST/GraphQL, request-response |
| Event-driven | `system-type-event-driven` | Message queues, event logs, pub/sub, hooks, reactive patterns |
| Data pipeline | `system-type-data-pipeline` | Batch/streaming processing, ETL, DAG scheduling |
| Workflow orchestration | `system-type-workflow-orchestration` | Multi-step processes, sagas, durable execution |
| CLI tool | `system-type-cli-tool` | Command-line interface, subcommands, plugin architecture |
| Real-time | `system-type-real-time` | WebSockets, persistent connections, state sync |
| Multi-tenant SaaS | `system-type-multi-tenant-saas` | Tenant isolation, shared infrastructure, billing |
| ML serving | `system-type-ml-serving` | Model serving, feature stores, inference pipelines |
| Distributed system | `system-type-distributed` | Consensus, replication, partitioning, multi-node coordination |
| Enterprise integration | `system-type-enterprise-integration` | Legacy modernization, API gateways, data integration |
| Edge / offline-first | `system-type-edge-offline` | Offline operation, sync protocols, constrained resources |
| Single-page app | `system-type-spa` | Client-side routing, state management, rendering strategies |
| Peer-to-peer | `system-type-peer-to-peer` | P2P topologies, NAT traversal, decentralized coordination |
| Azure-hosted | `system-type-azure` | Azure compute, identity, networking, managed services |

**Design philosophies** -- which does the system claim or embody?

| Philosophy | Skill | Applies when... |
|------------|-------|-----------------| 
| Linux/Unix | `design-philosophy-linux` | Mechanism vs policy, composability, small sharp tools |
| Domain-driven | `design-philosophy-domain-driven` | Bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, aggregates |
| Object-oriented | `design-philosophy-object-oriented` | SOLID, composition over inheritance, protocols/traits |

**After classifying, immediately load ALL matching skills:**
```
load_skill(skill_name="system-type-event-driven")
load_skill(skill_name="system-type-cli-tool")
load_skill(skill_name="design-philosophy-linux")
# ... every skill that matches
```

Present the classification to the user: **"I've classified this system as [types]. I've loaded domain skills for [list]. Does this classification match your understanding? Anything I should add?"**

**Why this matters:** Domain skills contain failure modes, anti-patterns, and evaluation criteria specific to each system type. Without them, the review produces generic findings. With them, findings are grounded in domain-specific patterns -- "this violates event-driven reliability patterns" rather than "this might have a timeout issue."

### Step 3: Evaluate Against the Codebase

If reviewing an existing system or a design that modifies one:
- Use `read_file`, `grep`, and `LSP` to examine the actual code
- Compare the design's claims against reality
- Identify gaps between the design document and the implementation

**Implementation viability check:** If the design proposes changes to an existing system, trace the impact exhaustively:
- Use LSP `findReferences` and `incomingCalls` to find every usage of components being changed
- For each usage, validate the new design can replace the old seamlessly
- Flag any callsite where the replacement is non-trivial or ambiguous

This is not optional exploration -- it is the mechanism that prevents "it worked in theory but broke 12 callsites" surprises.

### Step 4: Adversarial Analysis

Delegate the deep adversarial review rather than doing it inline:

**Option A -- Delegate to the systems-design-critic agent:**
```
delegate(
  agent="systems-design:systems-design-critic",
  instruction="Review this design: [design content or file path]. System context: [relevant codebase findings from Step 3]. System classification: [types from Step 2]",
  context_depth="recent",
  context_scope="agents"
)
```

**Option B -- Use the adversarial-review skill (spawns 6 parallel agents):**
```
load_skill(skill_name="adversarial-review")
```

Choose Option A when you have accumulated codebase context to pass along. Choose Option B for a quick parallel review when the design is self-contained.

**Pass the system classification to the agent.** The critic should know what type of system it is reviewing so it can apply domain-specific failure modes rather than generic concerns.

### Step 5: Tradeoff Validation

After the adversarial analysis returns, load the tradeoff-analysis skill if the review reveals unclear tradeoffs:
```
load_skill(skill_name="tradeoff-analysis")
```

Verify:
- Are the stated tradeoffs actually what the design achieves?
- Are there unstated tradeoffs the designers may not have recognized?
- Does the design optimize for what the team actually needs?

**Apply the Simplicity and DX lenses:**
- Isn't there a simpler way to accomplish what this design does? What concept have we uncovered that we didn't know before?
- Are we mixing two concerns here? Aren't these actually separate responsibilities?
- How many concepts must a developer hold in their head to use this correctly? Is the naming consistent and clear?
- Does this diverge from ecosystem conventions? If so, is the divergence justified?

### Step 6: Synthesize and Recommend

Present findings to the user.

**Before presenting, categorize each finding:**
- **Architectural** -- boundaries, data flow, failure modes, coupling, scalability, consistency model, state ownership. These belong in a systems-design review.
- **Implementation** -- code quality, specific function issues, API ergonomics, type safety, naming. These are useful but secondary.

If more than 30% of findings are implementation-level, you have drifted from the systems-design scope. Reframe implementation findings in architectural terms or separate them into a distinct section.

**Check design integrity before finalizing:**
- Is this design consistent with previous design decisions in the system? If not, is the inconsistency explicitly reconciled?
- Who owns this component? Does it really belong here, or are we changing the responsibility of something established?
- Does this introduce a second way to do something the system already does?

**Assessment Summary:**
- Overall health: [strong / has concerns / needs significant revision]
- Critical risks: [list]
- Tradeoff alignment: [does the design achieve what it claims?]

**Recommendation:** One of:
- **Proceed** -- risks are acceptable, design is sound
- **Proceed with modifications** -- [specific changes needed]
- **Reconsider** -- [fundamental issue that requires rethinking]

Ask: **"Do these findings match your intuition? Are there aspects of the design I should look at more closely?"**

### Step 7: Capture Action Items

If the user wants to proceed with modifications, produce a clear action list:
1. What to change (specific, not vague)
2. Why (linked to a specific risk or finding)
3. Priority (must-do vs should-do vs nice-to-do)
