# System Design Mode

Structured design exploration. Write tools are blocked -- this mode produces
design thinking, not files. Document creation is delegated to `systems-design-writer`.

**Companion skill:** `system-design-methodology` -- load it at mode entry for the
full 8-phase workflow, delegation patterns, and user validation checkpoints.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Phases |
|-------|------|--------|
| `systems-architect` | System-level reasoning (ANALYZE / DESIGN / ASSESS) | 1, 3, 4, 6 |
| `systems-design-critic` | Adversarial review from 5 perspectives | 5 (optional) |
| `systems-design-writer` | Pure document production, zero design decisions | 8 |

## Skills

| Skill | Phase |
|-------|-------|
| `system-design-methodology` | All -- companion skill for this mode |
| `architecture-primitives` | 3 -- selecting patterns for candidates |
| `tradeoff-analysis` | 4 -- detailed tradeoff methodology |
| `adversarial-review` | 5 -- parallel 5-perspective stress test |
| `system-type-web-service` | 3 -- when designing web services or APIs |
| `system-type-event-driven` | 3 -- when designing event-driven systems |
