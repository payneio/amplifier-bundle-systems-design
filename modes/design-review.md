# Design Review Mode

Evaluating an existing design or proposed architectural change. Write tools are
blocked -- this mode produces assessments, not code.

**Companion skill:** `design-review-methodology` -- load it at mode entry for the
full 6-step workflow, delegation patterns, and user validation checkpoints.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Steps |
|-------|------|-------|
| `systems-design-critic` | Adversarial review from 5 perspectives | 3 (Option A) |
| `systems-architect` | System-level assessment (ASSESS mode) | 2 (codebase evaluation) |

## Skills

| Skill | Step |
|-------|------|
| `design-review-methodology` | All -- companion skill for this mode |
| `adversarial-review` | 3 (Option B) -- parallel 5-perspective stress test |
| `tradeoff-analysis` | 4 -- validating stated vs actual tradeoffs |
