# Checkpoint 5: Repeatable Design Workflows via Recipes

> **Execution:** Use the subagent-driven-development workflow to implement this plan.

**Goal:** Add 3 recipe YAML files that orchestrate multi-step design workflows using our bundle's agents.
**Architecture:** Recipes are declarative YAML specs executed by the `recipes` tool. We create one staged recipe with approval gates (architecture-review), one flat recipe with parallel foreach (design-exploration), and one flat sequential recipe (codebase-understanding). All three use our agents (`systems-design:systems-architect`, `systems-design:design-critic`, `systems-design:design-writer`) plus the foundation explorer (`foundation:explorer`).
**Tech Stack:** Amplifier recipe system (YAML), staged mode with approval gates, foreach parallel execution, context accumulation.

### Task 1: Create the `recipes/` directory and `recipes/architecture-review.yaml`

**Files:**
- Create: `recipes/architecture-review.yaml`

**Step 1: Create the directory and file**

Create `recipes/architecture-review.yaml` with the following content. This is a **staged** recipe (uses `stages:` not `steps:`) with 3 stages and 2 approval gates, following the pattern from `related-projects/amplifier-bundle-recipes/examples/dependency-upgrade-staged-recipe.yaml`.

```yaml
name: "architecture-review"
description: "Multi-stage architecture review with approval gates between reconnaissance, analysis, and report phases"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "System Design Intelligence"
tags: ["architecture", "review", "system-design", "staged", "approval-gates"]

# Staged architecture review with approval gates.
#
# Three stages with human checkpoints:
# 1. Reconnaissance: Survey codebase, identify boundaries (no approval)
# 2. Multi-Perspective Analysis: Parallel analysis from 5 perspectives, synthesize risks (approval required)
# 3. Report: Produce the final architecture review document (approval required)
#
# Typical runtime: 10-20 minutes (includes approval wait times)
# Required agents: foundation:explorer, systems-design:systems-architect,
#                  systems-design:design-critic, systems-design:design-writer
#
# Usage:
#   Execute recipe with target_path=<path-to-codebase>
#
# Approval workflow:
#   - Recipe pauses at each approval gate
#   - Use recipe approvals tool to see pending approvals
#   - Approve to continue, deny to stop and review manually

context:
  target_path: ""                                    # Required: path to codebase or directory to review

        agent: "foundation:explorer"
        prompt: |
          Survey the codebase at {{target_path}}.

          Produce a structured overview:
          1. Directory layout and organization pattern
          2. Key entry points (main files, CLI, API endpoints, event handlers)
          3. Configuration files and their purposes
          4. Dependency manifest (package files, lock files)
          5. Test structure and coverage indicators
          6. Documentation files
          7. Build and deployment configuration

          Focus on facts. List what exists, where it lives, and how it's organized.

          For the codebase at: {{target_path}}

          Identify the system's architectural structure:

          1. **System boundaries**: Where are the service/module/package boundaries?
          2. **Major components**: What are the primary functional units?
          3. **Dependencies**: What external systems, services, or libraries are critical?
          4. **Data flows**: How does data enter, move through, and exit the system?
          5. **Integration points**: Where does this system connect to others?
          6. **Technology choices**: What frameworks, databases, messaging systems are in use?

          Present this as a structured system map. Identify areas of clarity and areas of ambiguity.
          Flag anything that looks unusual or potentially problematic, but do NOT make judgments yet.

          For failure-modes: What breaks? What is the blast radius? Are there single points of failure? How does the system degrade?
          For scalability: What grows with usage? Where are the bottlenecks at 10x? What becomes painful first?
          For developer-experience: How hard is it to understand, modify, test, and deploy? Where do developers struggle?
          For simplicity: What is unnecessarily complex? What could be removed? Where is YAGNI violated?

          Provide:
          1. Current state assessment (1-5 rating with justification)
          2. Key findings (3-5 specific items with evidence from the codebase)

          For the system at: {{target_path}}
          System map: {{system_map}}

          Produce:
          1. **Cross-cutting risks**: Issues that appear across multiple perspectives
          2. **Severity-ranked risk list**: All identified risks ordered by severity (critical first)
          3. **Conflicting recommendations**: Where perspectives disagree and why
          4. **Blind spots**: What wasn't covered or needs deeper investigation
          5. **Top 3 actions**: The highest-impact improvements regardless of perspective

          Be adversarial. Challenge optimistic assessments. Flag risks the individual perspectives may have underweighted.

      2. **Security reviewer**: What's the attack surface? Where are the trust boundaries weak?
      3. **Staff engineer**: Is this the right level of complexity? Will the team maintain this in 2 years?
      4. **Finance owner**: What are the cost drivers at scale? Where are the runaway risks?
      5. **Operator**: How do you deploy, monitor, debug, and rollback this?

      For each perspective:
      - Top risks (severity: critical/high/medium/low)
      - Specific failure scenarios
      - Mitigation recommendations

      Conclude with a unified assessment:

         (MVC, event-driven, layered, hexagonal, etc.) Are patterns consistent or mixed?

      ### Complexity Hotspots
      (Where complexity concentrates, why, and whether it's warranted)

      ### Architectural Debt
      (Pattern violations, workarounds, boundary erosion, inconsistencies)

      ### Strengths
      (What the architecture does well)

      ### Recommendations
      (Ordered by impact -- what would improve the architecture most)

      Ground every observation in specific evidence from the codebase.
    output: "architectural_overview"
    timeout: 600
```

**Step 2: Validate the recipe**

Run:
```
recipes operation=validate recipe_path=recipes/codebase-understanding.yaml
```
Expected: Validation passes with no errors.

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add recipes/codebase-understanding.yaml && git commit -m "feat: codebase-understanding recipe for architectural survey and analysis"
```

---

### Task 4: Verify all recipes

**Files:**
- Verify: `recipes/architecture-review.yaml`
- Verify: `recipes/design-exploration.yaml`
- Verify: `recipes/codebase-understanding.yaml`

**Step 1: Validate all 3 recipes**

Run each validation:
```
recipes operation=validate recipe_path=recipes/architecture-review.yaml
recipes operation=validate recipe_path=recipes/design-exploration.yaml
recipes operation=validate recipe_path=recipes/codebase-understanding.yaml
```
Expected: All 3 pass validation with no errors.

**Step 2: Verify recipe structure manually**

Check that each recipe follows the correct format:

1. `architecture-review.yaml`:
   - Uses `stages:` (not `steps:`) at the top level
   - Has 3 stages: `reconnaissance`, `analysis`, `report`
   - Stage 2 (`analysis`) has `approval: required: true`
   - Stage 3 (`report`) has `approval: required: true`
   - The foreach step uses `parallel: 3` and `collect: "perspective_analyses"`
   - All agent names are fully qualified (`systems-design:*`, `foundation:explorer`)

2. `design-exploration.yaml`:
   - Uses `steps:` at the top level
   - Has 4 steps: `frame-problem`, `generate-candidates`, `evaluate-tradeoffs`, `adversarial-review`
   - The foreach step (`generate-candidates`) uses `parallel: 3` and `collect: "candidate_designs"`
   - Step 4 (`adversarial-review`) has `condition: "{{with_adversarial_review}} == 'true'"`

3. `codebase-understanding.yaml`:
   - Uses `steps:` at the top level
   - Has 4 sequential steps: `survey-structure`, `identify-boundaries`, `map-flows`, `architectural-overview`
   - No foreach, no conditions, no approval gates
   - Each step's `output` is referenced by subsequent steps

**Step 3: Verify file listing**

Run:
```bash
ls -la recipes/
```
Expected: 3 files:
```
architecture-review.yaml
codebase-understanding.yaml
design-exploration.yaml
```

---

### Task 5: Final commit and structure verification

**Step 1: Check the full bundle structure**

Run:
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" \) | grep -v related-projects | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git/ | sort
```

Expected output should include all files from checkpoints 1-5:
```
./agents/design-critic.md
./agents/design-writer.md
./agents/systems-architect.md
./behaviors/system-design.yaml
./bundle.md
./context/instructions.md
./context/structured-design-template.md
./context/system-design-principles.md
./docs/plans/checkpoint-1-core-design-content.md
./docs/plans/checkpoint-2-design-skills.md
./docs/plans/checkpoint-3-design-modes.md
./docs/plans/checkpoint-4-design-agents.md
./docs/plans/checkpoint-5-design-recipes.md
./docs/planning/plan.v2.md
./modes/design-review.md
./modes/design.md
./recipes/architecture-review.yaml
./recipes/codebase-understanding.yaml
./recipes/design-exploration.yaml
./skills/adversarial-review/adversarial-review.md
./skills/architecture-primitives/architecture-primitives.md
./skills/system-type-event-driven/system-type-event-driven.md
./skills/system-type-web-service/system-type-web-service.md
./skills/tradeoff-analysis/tradeoff-analysis.md
```

**Step 2: Verify git status is clean**

Run:
```bash
git status
```
Expected: Working directory clean (all recipe files committed in Tasks 1-3).

**Step 3: If anything uncommitted, commit**

If there are uncommitted files:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: checkpoint 5 complete - 3 design workflow recipes"
```
